In this folder several databases, trained networks and corresponding Jupyter notebooks are presentend. For each of these to function they have to be placed into the main folder (so that they can acces the functions written). Here some information about what is in each file is given:
* 'DatabaseMin_1Width5_50k_0.9Cutt_40scans_0.1max_3ds_1dsDecent_4particles_2D.json' is a example database generated with a single width of 5Rc, it has approximatly 50K datapoints with 4 particles which were relaxed for 40 scans (with a maximum movement of 0.1Rc per epoch and a depth of surrounding cells of 1 for the relaxation) and used a depth of surrounding cells of 3 for the final potential energy calculation. It also had a energy cuttoff of 0.9.
* 'DatabaseMin_86Width1.5-10_100k_40scans_0.1max_3ds_1dsDecent_4particles_2D' is a example database generated with a multiple widths of between 1.5 and 100 Rc, it has approximatly 50K datapoints with 4 particles which were relaxed for 40 scans (with a maximum movement of 0.1Rc per epoch and a depth of surrounding cells of 1 for the relaxation) and used a depth of surrounding cells of 3 for the final potential energy calculation. It also had a energy cuttoff of 0.9.
* There are also several prepared versions of these
* Multiple Jupyter notebook in which these preperations are used for training of several neural networks are present.
* In the sub-folders the .h5 files of the models that are trained in the Jupyter notebooks.
