In this folder several databases, trained networks and corresponding Jupyter notebooks are presentend. For each of these to function they have to be placed into the main folder (so that they can acces the functions written). Here some information about what is in each file is given:
* 'DatabaseMin_1Width5_50k_0.9Cutt_40epochs_0.1max_3ds_1dsDecent_4particles_2D.json' is a example database generated with a single width of 5Rc, it has approximatly 50K datapoints with 4 particles which were relaxed for 40 epochs (with a maximum movement of 0.1Rc per epoch and a depth of surrounding cells of 1 for the relaxation) and used a depth of surrounding cells of 3 for the final potential energy calculation. It also had a energy cuttoff of 0.9.
* 'DatabaseMin_1Width5_50k_0.9Cutt_40epochs_0.1max_3ds_1dsDecent_4particles_2D_M2M3R0p20.json' is the prepared version of that database (with proximity matrices of order -2 and -3) with a R0p of 20Rc.
* 'machineLearningM2M3BiasSingleWidth.ipynb' is the Jupyter notebook in which this database is used for training of several neural networks.
* '0LinearNetwork0.46557734359635244.h5' and '1DenseLayerSmallSoftplus0.47684452027744717.h5' are two networks trained in that Jupyter notebook.
